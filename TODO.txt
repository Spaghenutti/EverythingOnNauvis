Features:
  - Add promethium asteroids when traveling to solar system edge: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/EverythingOnNauvis/discussion/68038ab7f0baa46ee78d5010

Bug fixes:
  + Romve the small random lava patches - See noise expression offset_vulcano - Check seed 379334167
  - Add back gleba water (wetland-blue-slime and gleba-deep-lake) and surround them by a land tile such that they do not touch nauvis water. I think without them gleba might have some solid terrain without plants
  - Show solar system view button in Map view

Config changes
  + Add setting for enable/disable demolishers (Already done by default)
  + Add setting for vulcano size
  + Add setting for vulcano frequenzy
  + Add space connection from nauvis to solar system edge
  + Make incompatible with Naufulglebunusilo
  + Make incompatible with Resource Spawner Overhaul
  + Add description to settings
  - Increase coal patch density by factor 2-3
  - Reduce stone by factor 2-3
  + change stack stizes of asteroid chunks
  - Consider changing casting recipes: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/EverythingOnNauvis/discussion/681abec547afb4fc3a0d4238
  - Make Everything on Nauvis more region based: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/EverythingOnNauvis/discussion/6818e9f53fea09b18dee3b34

Cosmetic changes
  ? Add promethium as ore
  + Add holmium ore - make it hard ore
  + check technology tree
    + Add Fulguran vault ruins, or unlock recycler by different method 
    + Unlock holmium processing by mining holmium ore
  + remove menu simulations
  + fix surface conditions for recipes
  - Add vulcanus / gleba cliffs. I think this is not easy to do...
  - Increase verly slowly but up to inf the moisture towards the south
  + Remove grass from vulcanus tiles volcanic-folds and volcanic-folds-flat
  + Restore big patches of trees. See: "also removes big patches of trees on map, but i would like to keep the forests"

Low Prio:
  + Make that calcite patch behaves like nauvis ore
  + Make that tungsten ore patch behaves like nauvis ore
  + remove north_offset and south_offset for aquilo and gleba and replace them for a similar function like starting_island local expression
  + for masks use code like "a > b" instead "if(a > b, 1, 0)"
